If you have any desire to be here, you likely belong here."],"faqs":[{"Q":"Is RARR an anonymous program?","A":"While RARR adheres to the principle of anonymity in practice, we avoid addressing it directly as many of our members could not blend into a crowd if their lives depended on it (and it often has!) These members are thus deeply offended by the word, so we don't use it. That said, we avoid talking about other members for the sake of our own spiritual, emotional and <b>physical</b> health.

We recommend visiting the RARR site, <a href=\"https://rarr-recovery.org\" target=\"rarr\">rarr-recovery.org</a>, on a regular basis, and consulting the standard ancient texts.
